WARNING: [Constraints 18-549] Could not create 'DIFF_TERM' constraint because cell 'gtwizard_0_exdes_i/IBUFDS_DRP_CLK' is not directly connected to top level port. 'DIFF_TERM' is ignored by Vivado but preserved inside the database.
Resolution: It is recommended to apply the I/O constraint directly to the top level port instead of applying the constraint to the cell connected to the port.
